Overview

This project investigates the relationship between bird populations in western Sweden and various climate variables, including local weather and large-scale teleconnection patterns (e.g., NAO, AAO, Scandinavian Pattern, and East Atlantic Pattern). The project utilizes machine learning, statistical correlation analysis, and factor analysis to identify key drivers of bird population fluctuations.

Dataset

The project utilizes:

Bird Population Data: From 2015â€“2022, filtered and processed to remove inconsistencies.

Climate Variables: Data from SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute), including air temperature, sea temperature, air pressure, wind speed, wave height, and seawater level.

Teleconnection Indices: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), Scandinavian Pattern, and East Atlantic Pattern.
